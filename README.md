Introduction
------------
OpenFrameworks Addon for developing Twitter based projects.

The original addon was created by Edric Stanley on 10/12/10 which was adapted from code by Paul Shen.
After that [Andrew Vergara](https://github.com/drewvergara) updated the addon to use the most recent version of [ofxHttpUtils] (https://github.com/arturoc/ofxHttpUtils)
With the new version of Twitter [API 1.1](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/overview) the old addon stopped working so I decided to start working in this new version.
