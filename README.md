OpenFrameworks Addon - ofxTwitter
Created by Andrew Vergara
Modified by Pelayo Méndez

Changes in this version:

* Updated for Twitter API v1.1. https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/overview
* Uses Christopher Baker ofxOAuth adddon https://github.com/bakercp/ofxOAuth 
* Uses ofxJSON for parsing data as XML is not supported anymore https://github.com/jefftimesten/ofxJSON 

The original addon was created by Edric Stanley on 10/12/10 which was adapted from code by Paul Shen.
Andrew Vergara https://github.com/drewvergara updated the addon to use the most recent version of ofxHttpUtils 
https://github.com/arturoc/ofxHttpUtils but with the new version of Twitter API the old addon stopped working 
so I decided to start working in this version.
